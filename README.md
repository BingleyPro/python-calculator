# Python Calculator
This is a calculator for functions like calculating GST, discounts, interest, unit conversions, time difference and much more! Feel free to use and modify as much as you like. This was mostly just a test project.

To use this, dowwload the **main.py** file and run it using Python 3. The files in the **experimental** folder are other small calculator experiments, some which don't work.
