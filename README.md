# Python Calculator
This is a calculator for functions like calculating GST, discounts, interest, unit conversions, time difference and much more! Feel free to use and modify as much as you like. This was mostly just a test project.

The files in the **experimental** folder are other small calculator experiments, some which don't work.

## How to Use
First, click on the **main.py** file to view the contents. Select all the text and copy it. Them, head to a Python compiler like https://www.online-python.com/ or https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/ and paste the code in there. The calculator is purely terminal based, just enter numbers when asked and click enter.
